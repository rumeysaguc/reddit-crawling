I\u2019ve been trying to communicate via fizz about this topic, but the content keeps getting removed.

I\u2019ve had a couple incidents of my own with him and have been trying to get more ppl to come forward so the school will do something about him. I\u2019m not a mandatory reporter or staff, but I can guide you through the process of reporting &/or moving forward. I\u2019m also here if you just need to talk. Rn, as far as I know, I am still the only person to file a Title IX report. If more people report, the school is obligated to take action. PLEASE consider reaching out to me &/or Title IX, police, res life, etc. \n\nStay safe out there and please know that there are people here to help."}{"counts_comment": 10, "score": 16, "title": "Current junior, AMA!", "selftext": "Hey y'all, current junior at Elon and I'm very involved on campus!

I\u2019m thinking about applying to Elon and had some questions if anyone was interested in sharing. Even answering just one would be helpful! Thanks :) \n\n1. How is the school spirit\u2014 football games/basketball? \n2. Are there a good amount of tailgates/darties? Do you need to be in Greek to go to them?\n3. How big is Greek life? Would not rushing put me at a disadvantage there?\n4. Are people generally nice there?\n5. What sports/clubs are popular/did you join?\n6. How did you make most of your friends here? \n7. What are the weekends like party wise, frats, bars, is partying popular?\n8. I\u2019ve heard the student culture is the preppy, southern type. Is this true and could you describe more in depth what it\u2019s like?\n9. How big is the campus? What surrounds the school?\n10. What was the one thing that made you want to come here?"}
